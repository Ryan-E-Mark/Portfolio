                    <p>I was born and raised in a small town in Alaska and love to spend time outdoors. For me, nature has always been a source of inspiration as well as a way to recalibrate and humble myself. I try to balance my seemingly ever increasing time in front of a screen with time spent where cell signal is sparce.</p>
